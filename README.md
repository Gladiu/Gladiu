### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am student of Automation Control and Robotics on Poznan University of Technology. \
I love C language and my editor of choice is Neovim. Python is my second favourite language and i use it for scientific simulations and writing games in Godot! \
I also work on my OpenGl Game in my free time but it takes a lot of time to develop a game and learn proper OpenGl.
To contact me add me to friends on gladiu#0309 and i should respond fast if I am not sleeping :D
