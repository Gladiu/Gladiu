### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am student of Automation Control and Robotics on Poznan University of Technology.
I mainly write in C for micro-controllers and use python or matlab for simulations, but in my free time i write some games in Godot which provides python-like language.
I also work on my OpenGl Game in my free time but it takes a lot of time to develop a game and learn proper OpenGl.
