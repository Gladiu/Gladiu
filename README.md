### Hi there 👋
I am student of Automation Control and Robotics on Poznan University of Technology 🎓 \
I love C language and my editor of choice is Neovim. Python is my second favourite language, I use it for scientific simulations and writing games in Godot! \
I also work on my OpenGl Game in my free time but it takes a lot of time to develop a game and learn proper OpenGl 🤓.\
\
##📝Contact me add me by adding me to friends on discord. I am gladiu#0309
